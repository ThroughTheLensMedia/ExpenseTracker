## [v7.1.0] — 2026-05-06

### Website Lead Capture — Full Pipeline

#### New Features
- **`POST /api/intake`** — Public server-to-server endpoint. Validates `x-intake-secret` header against `intake_keys` table (falls back to `LUMIERE_INTAKE_SECRET` env var for legacy support). Resolves owning `user_id`, deduplicates clients by email, inserts lead with `status: "New Lead"`.
- **Client deduplication** — Email-based case-insensitive lookup before any insert. Returning clients link to existing record; no duplicate contact cards. `isReturning: true` appended to lead notes.
- **`intake_keys` table** — Per-user API key storage (`id`, `user_id`, `key`, `label`, `created_at`, `last_used_at`). RLS-protected. Service role bypasses RLS for server-side lookups. Index on `key` for fast per-request validation.
- **`GET/POST/DELETE /api/intake-keys`** — Authenticated CRUD. Keys generated as `ll-{24-char UUID slug}`. `last_used_at` updated on every valid intake request (fire-and-forget).
- **`useLeadsRealtime` hook** — Supabase Realtime `postgres_changes` subscription on `leads` filtered by `user_id`. Fires slide-in toast (bottom-right, 8s, click navigates to CRM) and badge counter on new INSERT.
- **Badge on nav** — Red dot badge on bottom nav Leads icon and dropdown CRM Pipeline link. Clears on navigation to `/crm`. `9+` cap for overflow.
- **IntegrationTab** — New Control Center tab (`?tab=integration`). Generate labeled intake keys, copy `LUMIERE_INTAKE_URL` + `LUMIERE_INTAKE_SECRET` env vars, view code snippet for Cloudflare Worker integration, revoke keys with confirm dialog.
- **AddOns page (`/addons`)** — Marketplace listing available add-ons with feature lists and CTAs. Coming-soon add-ons: Website Builder, Client Portal, Contract E-Sign. Linked from main nav dropdown.
- **TTLM `form.js` v2.0.0** — Complete rewrite of Cloudflare Pages Function. Success gate: Turnstile verification + owner Resend email. All secondary tasks (GAS, D1, customer confirmation, Lumière intake) are fire-and-forget via `context.waitUntil`. Form never fails due to downstream dependency.

#### Changed
- `server.js` — Mounts `intakeRouter` (public, before auth middleware) and `intakeKeysRouter` (authenticated, after auth middleware).
- `AuthContext.jsx` — Exports `supabase` client for use by `useLeadsRealtime` without creating a second client instance.
- `App.jsx` — Imports `AddOns` page, adds `/addons` route, adds 🧩 Add-Ons link to dropdown nav.
- `Backup.jsx` — Adds `IntegrationTab` import, adds `'integration'` to valid tab list, renders `IntegrationTab` for `activeTab === 'integration'`, adds 🔗 Integrations tab button.

#### Database
- New migration: `docs/supabase_schema_intake_keys.sql` — run in Supabase SQL Editor to activate multi-tenant intake keys.

#### Env Vars Added
- `LUMIERE_INTAKE_SECRET` — Legacy single-owner secret (backward compat, optional once DB keys are active).
